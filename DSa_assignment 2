1.In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence
2.There are four key types of linked lists:
Singly linked lists.
Doubly linked lists.
Circular linked lists.
Circular doubly linked lists.
3.Linked lists are linear data structures that hold data in individual objects called nodes. These nodes hold both the data and a reference to the next node in the list. Linked lists are often used because of their efficient insertion and deletion

4.Advantages of Linked List over Array
1) Dynamic Data Structure:
2) No Memory Wastage:
3) Implementation:
4) Insertion and Deletion Operation:
1) Memory Usage:
2) Random Access:
3) Reverse Traversal:


5.Applications of Circular Linked List. Circular lists are used in applications where the entire list is accessed one-by-one in a loop. It is also used by the Operating system to share time for different users, generally uses a Round-Robin time-sharing mechanism.

6.A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle. There are basically two types of circular linked list: 1. Circular Singly Linked List. Here, the address of the last node consists of the address of the first node.
Circular Linked List Complexity: Time Complexity
Insertion Operation: O(1) or O(n)
Deletion Operation: O(1)
